        <p><strong>Welcome to the ProjectSWG Development Page!</strong></p>

<p>ProjectSWG is an MMO server emulation project which aim is to emulate Star Wars Galaxies at its final publish before closing. ProjectSWG started work in 2011 after the announcement was made that Star Wars Galaxies would shut down on 12/15/2011. Since then we have researched the protocol between SOE's server and the SWG Client and have developed our own server (and the engine which powers the server) from the ground up. </p>

<p>The current iteration of our server, NGECore2, was created after realising that our initial codebase was flawed and could not be maintained the way it was. NGECore2 uses several technologies like the Jython Scripting library to make life easier for developers and to encourage community contributions. </p>
